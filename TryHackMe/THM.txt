ðŸ§  Intro to LAN â€“ Summary

*A Local Area Network (LAN) connects devices within a small area (like a school, home, or office).

-Main devices: Router, Switch, Access Point, and Hosts (computers/laptops).
-The router connects the LAN to the internet and assigns IPs using DHCP.
-The switch connects multiple devices and uses MAC addresses to forward frames.
-IP Address = identifies a device on the network.
-MAC Address = unique hardware identifier for network communication.
-Subnet Mask = defines which IPs are part of your local network.
-Default Gateway = the routerâ€™s IP that sends traffic out of your LAN.
-DNS (Domain Name System) = converts domain names (like google.com) into IPs.
-ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) = maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.



Commands I Practiced:

-ipconfig â†’ shows IP, subnet, and gateway.
-ping â†’ checks connectivity with another device or website.
-arp -a â†’ shows IP -- MAC address mappings.
-tracert â†’ shows the path packets take to reach a destination (like 8.8.8.8).

What I Learned:

-How devices inside a LAN communicate using MAC and IP addresses.
-How packets move from my device â†’ router â†’ internet.
-How to analyze network connectivity using basic commands.

*Understanding this is essential for networking and cybersecurity basics.
