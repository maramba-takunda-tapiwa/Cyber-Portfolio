Today I performed network commands on Windows Powershell and I saw all the information my device has and how it is connected to my WIFI router :

* ipconfig /all
- I identified the IPv4 address which a type of IP which allows 2^32 different   addresses to be assigned to devices on the internet 
- I identified the Default gateway which is used on subnetting to allow a device to communicate with another device which is not on the same network
- I identified the DNS Server which allocates IP addresses to devices which do not have any IP addresses assigned to them 

* ping {IP address or website URL}
- This showed me how packets are transferred through using the Internet Control Message Protocol which suffices packets when they are getting transferred . It can also be used to test to see if another device is reachable  
- The ping is the one which measures the amount of time it takes for packets to reach their final destination , generally measures latency
below is the results of performing the ping command :
